# Stock-API-tools

Hi every one, I just moved this project from my personal space to Github.
This program allows user to access real-time stock data(delay depends on the API provider).
It has an Andriod interface.
API provided by Sina Finance, finance.sina.com

Current program only support real-time stock data. Source code has been upload.

Futre developement:
  1. Historical stock data retrieve.
  2. User interface modification.
  3. New feature, save user search history.
  4. New feature, user dashboard with user choice of stock data displayed.
  5. Diagram support, K line etc.
